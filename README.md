# US Mortgage Market Analysis
Some financial institutions and banks in the US are required to report data about the mortgages granted to the public due to the [Home Mortgage Disclosure Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act).

This projects aims to perform an exploratory analysis of the loan-leve data reported in the year 2021. 

The complete analysis can be found in the Jupyter Notebook within this repository.
