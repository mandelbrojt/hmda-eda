# US Mortgage Lending Analysis

This project conducts an exploratory analysis on the loan-level data reported by banks and financial institutions in the United States on mortgages granted to the public. The [Home Mortgage Disclosure Act](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/) mandates that certain banks and institutions in the US report this information periodically.

The dataset used in this project was downloaded as a CSV file directly from the [HMDA Dataset Filtering](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-browser/data/2021?category=nationwide) website. It contains 26 million records and 99 columns that banks and financial institutions reported nationwide in 2021. The original file size is 10.21 gigabytes.

The full analysis can be found in the only Jupyter Notebook in this repository.
